Essentially the first instances of Fieldwork and the beginnings of Participant Observation`}</p>\n    <p>{`Moved to the United States in 1885, and began getting into debates with Armchair Anthropologists writing comparative texts from the comfort of Oxford.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Took on academics like Edward Tyler Burnett and James Frazer (author of The Golden Bough) debating how we should do comparative studies of human cultures.`}</p>\n    <p>{`At this point \"anthropology\" was primarily thought of as Biological Anthropology, Archeology, Linguistics, and museum curation. There was a lot of skull-measuring going on to categorise people according to physical characteristics.`}</p>\n    <p>{`There was a specific preoccupation with trying to draw correlations between cranial features, facial angles, and patterns of behaviour. \"Using systematic observation of the outward traits of individuals to arrive at conclusions about the apparent differences across social groups\" (66)`}</p>\n    <p>{`Boas befriended Grant Stanley Hall, one of the original pioneers of the field of Psychology. Hall was setting up the brand new Clark University in Massachusetts, and appointed Boas to a lecturer position in Anthropology - despite it not being an established subject yet.`}</p>\n    <p>{`He moved to Chicago in time for the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, held to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' arrival in the New World in 1492. Anthropologists saw it as a chance to \"define itself as a coherent field of knowledge\" (62)`}</p>\n    <p>{`Franz Boas helped found the American Anthropological Association, and its official publication American Anthropologist.`}</p>\n    <p>{`After World War I, Franz Boas began teaching at Colombia University, and found many of his best students were women - often admitted from Barnard College nearby. This was where he encountered Ruth Benedict and Margaret Mead`}</p>\n    <hr></hr>\n    <h2>{`The Concept of Race in the 18th-20th Century`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Throughout the 18th Century and 19th Century, it was taken for granted that humans came in a set of \"natural\" categories - distinct `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`races`}</strong>{`. Discernible through a series of physical characteristics and behaviour traits. The same way dogs come in breeds.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Johann Blumenbach, a German anatomist, defined the initial finite set; Ethiopians, American, Mongolians, Malay, and Caucasians. Others built off this speculating on certain sub-races and species.`}</p>\n    <p>{` Madison Grant, an American with a particular fondness for Eugenics, wrote a book called \"`}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`The Passing of the Great Race`}</strong>{` in 1916. It was enormously popular at the time, and \"hailed as a milestone in the application of scientific ideas to history and public policy.\" The book argued the United States needed to maintain \"racial fitness,\" and was going to hell in a hand basket because \"White Nordic Americans\" were being outnumbered by supposedly inferior races.`}</p>\n    <p>{` Franz Boas initially received funding to go out and measure how well certain 'races' were assimilating into the great American melting pot. His graduate students spread across Chicago measuring skulls, noses, eye colours, and scales.`}</p>\n    <p>{` After thousands of measurements, it turned out there was no such thing as a \"jew,\" \"pole,\" or \"slovak,\" in purely physical terms. \"The conditions of life, from diet to environment, were having a quick and measurable effect on head forms that were thought to be fixed, inheritable, and indicative of one's essential type.\" (98)`}</p>\n    <p>{` Boas and his students had to conclude races were not a stable, objective reality, but rather a socially-constructed and wildly variable concept.`}</p>\n    <hr></hr>\n    <h2>{`Ruth Benedict, Gender & Cultural Abnormality`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Ruth Benedict became one of Franz Boas' students in 1921.

They were primarily Matrilineal and had a well-established tradition of male-to-female gender crossing known as `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`berdache`}</strong>{` (named by the French) where men could take on the social role of women - dressing, acting, and being in sexual relationships as women. For the Zuni \"a woman could have a penis; a man could wear a wedding dress.\" (124)`}</p>\n    <p>{`Homosexuality was also acceptable among the Zuni - it was \"socially placed\" – \"they had a specific role that both set them apart from the standard structure of their society and still wrapped them safely inside it\" (125)`}</p>\n    <p>{`Benedict wrote a key paper titled `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Anthropology and the Abnormal`}</strong>{` that argued insanity, abnormality, and deviance are all culutrally-constructed concepts.  `}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`\"Deviance\" and \"insanity\" is simply a mismatch between an individual's way of being in the world – their emotions, tendencies, behaviours – and the available catalogue of social roles and values in the society they belong to.`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>{`\"For nearly any deviants or miscreants you could name, `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`it was possible to identify a society where their afflictions produced not just acceptable lives but easy, honourable ones, too`}</strong>{`\" (125)`}</p>\n    <p>{`\"Trance seekers and cataleptics, neurotics and the possessed, schizophrenics and the chronically depressed were `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`categories impossible to define outside the local contexts in which these conditions manifest themselves`}</strong>{`\" (125)`}</p>\n    <p>{`\"Normalcy in any society was only an edited version of the grand text of all possible human behaviours; there was no reason to expect that every society would do the editing in precisely the same way. `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Ways of being in the world were abnormal only in the sense that the local context created 'the psychic dilemmas of the socially unavailable'`}</strong>{`\" (126)`}</p>\n    <hr></hr>\n    <h2>{`The Historical Context of Margaret Mead`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Margaret Mead was born at the turn of the century in to academic parents - a sociologist and an economist.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Primarily raised on New England, she eventually studied at Barnard College where she fell in with a group of \"freethinking, adventurous women, dissolved but intellectually fashionable,\" (129) and studied anthropology under Franz Boas and Ruth Benedict.
