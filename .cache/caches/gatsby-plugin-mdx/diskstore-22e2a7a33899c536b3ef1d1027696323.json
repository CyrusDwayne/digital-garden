Unfortunately its `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/\"\n      }}>{`complexity led to troubles`}</a>{`, and Berners-Lee's version of hypertext won out.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Despite the fact we're not currently browsing the Xanadu web, Nelson is still full of provocative, insightful ideas that never quite came to life – some that speak to many of the issues currently plaguing the modern web and are worth revisiting.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Two of the most intruiging are `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Transclusion`}</strong>{` and `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Transcopyright`}</strong>{`, a pair of concepts that reimagine the way authorship, attribution, copyright, and content monetization might work online.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Transclusion`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Transclusion is including one part of a document into another, and maintaing a link between the two. `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`This is different to copying.`}</strong>{` A copy isn't inherently linked to it's original, and can be changed in the duplicate version.`}</p>\n    <p>{`A transclusion is directly linked to the original, and contains the exact same contents. Someone viewing the transclusion can easily open and view the original document. By doing this, transclusions create a single source of truth for that element, and a [`}{`[Bi-Directional Link]`}{`] so you can navigate between the original source and its instances across the web.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Now, what happens if the original source changes?`}</p>\n    <p>{`The transclusion doesn't automatically  change along with it. If transclusions were direct embeds of the original content, we'd end up with `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot\"\n      }}>{`link rot`}</a>{` on a whole new scale. Every document would be a sad compilation of 404's.`}</p>\n    <p>{`You've probably' seen this happen with images – `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`<img>`}</inlineCode>{` tags where the `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`src`}</inlineCode>{` element points to an original source URL are essentially embeds. If the original publisher deletes the photo, your image dissappears along with it.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Instead, a transclusion is more like a saved version of the original – a `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`cached`}</em>{` snapshot of it at a moment in time. You can update that snapshot to a newer version if you want to, but it's not automatic. Even if the original author deletes it, your transcluded version stays visible.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It works the same way `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git\"\n      }}>{`Git`}</a>{` does – it's a version control system that stores the state of a file at a particular point in time.`}</p>\n    <BasicImage margin=\"1.6em auto 1.2em\" width=\"620px\" alt=\"Two documents connected by a transclusion.

We are constantly presented with isolated soundbites, quotes, and tweets that are divorced from the context they were created within.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It would create a more layered and nuanced form of hypertext – something we're exploring in the [`}{`[Digital Gardening]`}{`] movement. We could build accumulative, conversational exchanges with people on the level of the word, sentence, and paragraph, not the entire document. Authors could fix typos, write revisions, and push version updates that propogate across the web the same way we do with software.`}</p>\n    <p>{`On the flip side, we can also imagine transclusions that once held bible quotes linking back to pages that are now filled with fiery smut. This sort of bad behaviour is inevitable to some degree, but could be minimised through thoughtful design patterns that I'll touch on later. Cultivating strong social norms, making social reputation visible, and enabling community moderation are all potential tools for it.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Transcopyright`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Transcopyright is an extension of transclusion that begins to make this very interesting for attribution, copyright, and monetisation – we begin to see how this might evolve into a sustainable economic system.`}</p>\n    <p>{`If text is able to be endlessly embedded across the web in a way that leads back to a single source and a single publisher, you can theoretically pay that person for every instance of their content showing up on the web.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In this alternate web utopia, readers would pay small amounts for reading content on the web. These `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`micropayments`}</em>{` need to be truly micro for this to work.
