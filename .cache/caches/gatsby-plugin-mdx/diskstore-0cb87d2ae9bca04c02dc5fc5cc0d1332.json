On the central website Quantifiedself.com, they define themselves as a ‚Äúcollaboration of users and tool-makers who share an interest in self-knowledge through self-tracking‚Äù (Quantified Self 2013). As of April 2013, there are currently 111 registered meet-up groups consisting of 18,558 members across 31 nations in 89 cities‚Äìthese mini-communities are represented in New York, San Francisco, London and Tokyo, and also extend to places such as Rio de Janeiro, Bangkok, Beijing and Cape Town (Meetup 2013). However, as a geographical trend, the the vast majority of tracking communities are condensed within the Global North.\nMeet-ups are regularly scheduled, organised events where members can share their stories of self-experimentation. Run through the website Meetup.com, each geographical area has local voluntary leaders who facilitate the monthly gatherings. These meetings centre around a series of slide-show presentations, called ‚Äúshow-and-tells,‚Äù which are usually filmed and later uploaded to internet blogs and websites (Christensen 2013). Anthropologist Adam Butterfield conducted his master‚Äôs thesis specifically on Quantified Self community meet-up groups and succinctly defined their content as ‚Äúpersonal stories of self-tracking projects‚Äù (Butterfield 2012). While this is a simplified description of how the ideology gets communicated between its members and the general public, in a literal sense its is fairly accurate. The emphasis on storytelling using meaningful data is a key component of the Quantified Self movement. Understanding how and why these stories are told is central to understanding the Quantified Self movement and the cultural forces driving and shaping it. Throughout this thesis I will cite many tracking tales told through blog posts, personal websites, filmed presentations, and second-hand accounts in articles. At meet-up presenters are advised to base their talk around three prime questions; first, explain what you did; second, explain how you did it; and third, explain what you learnt (Wolf 2011). Some meet-up communities further structure the story-telling form by suggesting that speakers limit their talks to five minutes, encouraging simple and clear communication (Christensen 2013). The purpose of these presentations is to offer ideas that others might spark inspiration from: different tools and methods for self-tracking, different variables to track, inventive solutions to common problems like trouble sleeping or stress at work. The movement sees themselves as trying to cultivate a ‚Äúculture of sharing‚Äù (Christensen 2013). The ultimate value they share is seeking self-improvement, and through sharing stories, hope to collaboratively encourage and support one another in that goal. Conferences follow a similar structure but are much larger events, usually drawing members from all over a region (such as Europe or the Pacific Northwest) instead of a single city.\n\nThe glue holding this community together is undeniably the website Quantifiedself.com. Much like an ever-expanding family tree, it branches outwards connecting a seemingly infinite number of links to online data logging tools, company pages for commercially produced tracking devices and services, YouTube and Vimeo videos of presentations, reviews of smartphone tracking applications, notable personal blogs of self-trackers, and relevant journalistic and academic articles. It is the central hub of this internet-based society.\nQuantifiedself.com features many aspects typical of websites that facilitate open and interactive online societies; social forums, active commenting on blog postings, occasional surveys, prompts for open discussions, frequent guest writers, and interviews with notable community members (Quantified Self 2013). This includes a number of recurring features such as: ‚ÄúWhat We‚Äôre Reading‚Äù ‚Äì a compiled list of the latest publications and articles related to the Quantified Self movement, ‚ÄúToolmaker Talks‚Äù ‚Äì question and answer posts with the developers of popular tracking devices and applications, and ‚ÄúNumbers from Around the Web‚Äù ‚Äì a showcase of especially interesting self-experiments and the resulting data from community members (Quantified Self 2013). This small slice of what type of content is posted should make apparent this website is by no means written or controlled by a single or small handful of individuals.\n\nWhile Kevin Kelly, Gary Wolf, and Alexandria Carmichael are the official moderators, the \nmajority of the material is generated from a large and diverse number of contributors. 2\n\n2 Alexandria Carmichael is also the director of Quantified Self Labs, and co-founded the health tracking website CureTogether; a health care company ‚Äúthat brings patients with hundreds of conditions together in overlapping data communities‚Äù (CureTogether 2013).\n\nBeing an online social group, the nature of the Quantified Self community is fairly fluid with members interacting over ‚Äúmultisited situations with complex, spatially diverse‚Äù geographies (Wilson and Peterson 2002:455). In their review of the Anthropology of Online Communities, Wilson and Peterson point out that they are likely to be bound by ‚Äúasymmetrical, indirect connections,‚Äù as people are able to identify with the idea of being part of the community without necessarily making direct personal connections with others (Wilson and Peterson 2002:455). They may simply feel engagement and membership by reading the thoughts and ideas of other members on websites and blogs. The practices of connection can sometimes be socially passive. This quality makes the Quantified Self community an imagined community, a concept developed by political scientist Benedict Anderson to describe a socially-constructed unit where its members understand themselves to be part of a bound whole even in the absence of face-to- face interactions or social events. Becoming part of a community simply requires they imagine themselves to be so, much like being a member of a nation (Anderson 1991). However, in the case of the Quantified Self community, there are also many socially active and physically interactive ways members are bound together. Though geographically spread out over nations and internet cables, there is still a face-to-face aspect of the Quantified Self community in their regularly organised physical meet-ups and conferences. Quantified Self has been described as ‚Äúa grass-roots movement brought together by the internet‚Äù (Harrell 2011), emphasising its nature as democratic and community-driven. This strengthens their resemblance to traditional, localised communities where members are more likely to make direct and personal connections with one another.\n\n\nLeadership, Power Structures & Cohesion\nAlthough Kevin Kelly and Gary Wolf are often referred to as the ‚Äúleaders‚Äù of the movement, the community tries to cultivate an open and democratic power structure where no single person or set of people speak for everyone. There are, however, many members who are more outspoken and active in publishing ideological writings on the Quantified Self, sometimes referred to as ‚Äúthought leaders‚Äù (Erwin 2012). These are individuals who usually run high-traffic blogs about their Quantified Self lifestyles, regularly publishing advice, reflections, and generally contributing content to the online community and the discussions happening within it. Quantified Selfers may not exactly align their tracking beliefs and habits with members who might be considered ‚Äúpopular‚Äù (who themselves hold a diverse range of beliefs around self- tracking), yet these individuals may have greater power and sway within the community thanks to their ability to influence the opinions of their readers. These informal leaders are frequently featured in interviews, articles, and publications about the movement. They appear to be prominent and well-respected figures within the community, with smaller self-tracking blogs frequently referring to and citing them in posts. However, they should not themselves be taken as absolute representations of the movement, nor should they be assumed to speak on behalf of the entire community (Erwin 2012). In his ethnographic work, Butterfield found it is certainly ‚Äúnot a monolithic community where everyone involved shares the same ideas about, and interests in, self-tracking‚Äù (Butterfield 212:49). Though Kelly and Wolf may have run the first Quantified Self meet-up, both believe the movement has ‚Äútaken on a life of its own, and in some ways, taken on a different meaning‚Äù (Butterfield 2012:16). The Quantified Self ideology itself has evolved in its short six year history, with different philosophies, values, and areas of focus rising and falling in popularity ‚Äì none consistent throughout or representative of the whole community, but fluctuating and developing through community discussions and dialogues. Above all other qualities of the movement, this lack of deterministic authority and communal openness to change maturation, and development of what it means to be a ‚ÄúQuantified Selfer‚Äù might be of the most seminal importance to understanding it authentically.\n\n\n\nOn Ethnographic Sources\nThe vast majority of my ethnographic material is drawn from blog postings, essays, interviews in journalistic publications and newspapers, and filmed presentations created by people who make up the dedicated core of the movement. They are the leaders and avid participants, the organisers and enthusiasts, the writers and researchers. You will notice a repetition of names throughout my work: individuals like Kevin Kelly, Gary Wolf, Ernesto Ramirez, Konstantin Augemberg, Larry Smarr, gwern branwen [sic], and Buster Benson, among others, are all continuously cited across its chapters. The dominance of their voices is due to the dominance of their influence across the Quantified Self community, and the extensive efforts they put into writing and publishing about it. I recognise that this leaves my analysis vulnerable as an inaccurate representation of the more common or ‚Äútypical‚Äù Quantified Selfer who may not widely promote their beliefs and philosophies about self-tracking in publicly accessible places. However, there is no ‚Äúnormal‚Äù when it comes to the Quantified Self movement ‚Äì its membership is characterised by a wide diversity of opinions, habits, and levels of involvement. I have done my best to cast my net wide in selecting blogs, recorded talks, and stories to quote from and analyse ‚Äì presenting accounts ranging the ‚Äúthought leaders‚Äù who upload every detail of their day to public websites, to those who have only dabbled in a single experiment of self-quantification. Yet I concede my sources are limited to those who have chosen to freely share their experiences over the internet, a potentially self-selecting group. I have also likely left out the voices of many slightly less prominent ‚Äúthought leaders,‚Äù simply by limitation of the sheer number of them heading up different factions of the community, and that their opinions overlapped with those already represented. I have to some degree relied on the insights of anthropologists who are able to be physically present at Quantified Self meet-ups and conferences, primarily the work of Dawn Nafus and Jamie Sherman, and Adam Butterfield. Their expressed insights about the community, after engaging with people face-to-face and conducting many interviews, I believe grants them considerable legitimacy as second-hand ethnographic sources. -->","position":{"start":{"line":209,"column":1,"offset":13124},"end":{"line":231,"column":2325,"offset":24965},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"jsx","value":"<!-- \n\nThe Self-Tracker Identity\nIdentifying as a ‚ÄúQuantified Selfer‚Äù (the predominant self-referentially used term) requires two things; first, a lifestyle based around tracking data about oneself, and second, a conscious willingness to identity as such 3 \n\n3  Throughout this thesis I will use the terms ‚ÄúQuantified Selfer,‚Äù ‚ÄúSelf Quantifier,‚Äù ‚Äúquantifier,‚Äù ‚Äúself- tracker,‚Äù and ‚Äútracker‚Äù interchangeably. This is based on the way I found those five terms to be used within the ethnographic material of the Quantified Self community. For the purposes of this paper you should assume they all refer to the same social identity being discussed here.\n\nBeing an identified Quantified Selfer is voluntary and self-assigned. An ownership of their tracking activity as a significant aspect of who they believe themselves to be. It is a public expression of a set of values and ideals that privately can hold a wide variety of meanings. Beyond the core belief in seeking self-improvement through collecting data, the rest is left up to the individual: track what you want, how you want, and do what you like with the data (Wolf 2010a). This open-ended invitation to have total agency of your own self-tracking lifestyle makes involvement and membership in the movement exceedingly undefined. What exactly it means to be a Quantified Selfer falls on a wide spectrum, and there are degrees to which a person can identify with and be involved in the community. Those who present at conferences and actively organise meet-ups likely take the identity more seriously than those who simply wear a popular commercial tracking device and occasionally read the Quantifiedself.com blog posts. Essentially, the level of involvement is flexible and the line between being a Quantified Selfer or not is fuzzy at best. This grey-area around what counts as being a ‚Äúmember‚Äù of the tracking movement requires some clarification as to who exactly I am discussing in this research. Therefore, I wish to clarify that am considering the baseline of membership to be an explicit, public and purposeful ownership of being a Quantified Selfer\n\nDespite the wide variety of forms being a Quantified Selfer can take, and the insistence by community members that there is no such thing as an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù self-tracker, they certainly perceive a certain type of person to be drawn to the movement (Augemberg 2013a). They describe people who join as ‚Äúcurious‚Äù and ‚Äúgoal-oriented or problem-solving\noriented‚Äù (Christensen 2013). Many come from a science-minded perspective and are interested in ‚Äúpoking, prodding, and measuring as a way to go about the world‚Äù (Cornell 2010). Though inspired by scientific curiosity, they also revel in questioning existing mainstream social institutions like biomedicine and technoscience, believing their practices go against the grain of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù society. They repeatedly speak about themselves in narratives and terms that imply independence, difference, rebelliousness, radical thinking, and being defiant of the status quo, such as being self-proclaimed ‚Äúpioneers‚Äù (Kelly 2011; Wolf 2010a). Joining the movement seems to be more likely if you possess these certain character traits, but community members also suggest being part of the movement strengthens these qualities and subsequently changes the kind of lives people lead. Augemberg argues that the practice of self-tracking, Quantified Selfers become ‚Äúdifferent from other people with regard to mentality, psychological traits, lifestyle, and behaviours‚Äù (Augemberg 2013a). There is no doubt the movement understands itself as a social collective of like-minded individuals sharing an established set of values, qualifying them as a community.\n\n\n\nShifting Norms\nBack in 2010 ‚Äì the relative ‚Äúearly years‚Äù of the movement ‚Äì Wolf wrote of extreme quantifiers considering their behaviour to be ‚Äúabnormal,‚Äù and calling themselves ‚Äúoutliers‚Äù (Wolf 2010a). While the community still associates with leading lifestyles that deviate from the norm, many are experiencing a shift in the previously bizarre becoming more acceptable. Compulsive recordings of bodily numbers are no longer necessarily characterised as some form of anxiety disorder or signal of a lack of mental stability (Wolf 2010a). Still, in his ethnography Butterfield found self-trackers reported reluctance to divulge the full extent their tracking habits to those outside the movement, fearing they may be stigmatised and labeled ‚Äúobsessive compulsive, self- absorbed, or a hypochondriac‚Äù (Butterfield 2012: 60). They report others in their lives label them ‚Äúweird,‚Äù and yet simultaneously are assured that ‚Äúsoon everybody is going to be doing this, and you won‚Äôt even notice‚Äù (Wolf 2010a). The movement‚Äôs expansion seemingly instills confience that greater social acceptance is on the way. It therefore greatly serves the interests of those within the movement to promote the self-tracking lifestyle as increasingly normal and ordinary.\nMany of the outspoken leaders of the movement are, naturally, quite optimistic about its potential rising popularity. Kelly sees the next century as leading us into an age of quantification; he believes industry will spur a new side to science and a new kind of lifestyle. He sees ‚Äúnew money, new tools, and a new philosophy stemming from measuring your whole life... It will be the new normal‚Äù (Kelly 2011). As this shift continues, it creates an interesting interplay with the dominant narratives that Quantified Selfers tell themselves about being ‚Äúpioneering self- trackers‚Äù (Kelly 2011). How they will maintain this core aspect of their collective identity if indeed their prediction of going mainstream is fulfilled remains to be seen.\n\n\nSelf-Producing Pioneers\nFittingly, one intriguing quality of Quantified Selfers is the high number who are also the creators, inventors, and developers of self-tracking tools. In line with their philosophy of self- customisation and personalisation in the practice of self-tracking, it makes sense that many feel it is worth developing their own tools to serve their own specific interests and needs. Described as ‚Äútechnophiles, founders, and early adopters,‚Äù they engage in both the production and the use of their technological tools ‚Äì a continuous, circular feedback system (Dembosky 2011; Maqubela 2012). As most work in the industry of producing technological goods, they already have the skills and knowledge to do so. The New York meet-up survey cited earlier found that 30% of their members either work for a self-tracking related company or have created a self- quantification tool (Paulus 2013). Being both the creators and consumers of cutting edge tools and technological advancements legitimises their ‚Äúpioneer‚Äù self-image to an extent. They closely follow not only the new commodified gadgets and software applications that emerge on the market, but also the advances in computational power systems one step removed from the public eye ‚Äì inventions that could lead to possible new ways of integrating technologies into the self. They are inventing entirely new devices to integrate into their bodies, leading the frontier of technological development in an effort to be even more enmeshed in the digital age of enhancement. In this role they are shaping the forms and purposes of the technology that ‚Äútrickles down‚Äù to the rest of us in the mainstream hordes of technological consumerism. We should especially care about what they find significant, important, and meaningful - because to an extent they hold the power to determine what kind of technology we will use, and what we will use it for.

There are no full time employees and they have a stated goal of ‚Äúnot making organising QS feel like work‚Äù (Butterfield 2012:16). `}</p>\n    <p>{`The community aims to promote an egalitarian and democratic power structure by downplaying officiality and hierarchy.`}</p>\n    <hr></hr>\n    {\n      /* \n      Community Organisation\n      The community aspect of the Quantified Self movement is intentional and active; bounded together by voluntary, self-expressed membership, they connect through online hubs that typically include forum posts, twitter conversations, blog entries with streams of discussion comments, and informative resource pages such as wikis. On the central website Quantifiedself.com, they define themselves as a ‚Äúcollaboration of users and tool-makers who share an interest in self-knowledge through self-tracking‚Äù (Quantified Self 2013). As of April 2013, there are currently 111 registered meet-up groups consisting of 18,558 members across 31 nations in 89 cities‚Äìthese mini-communities are represented in New York, San Francisco, London and Tokyo, and also extend to places such as Rio de Janeiro, Bangkok, Beijing and Cape Town (Meetup 2013). However, as a geographical trend, the the vast majority of tracking communities are condensed within the Global North.\n      Meet-ups are regularly scheduled, organised events where members can share their stories of self-experimentation. Run through the website Meetup.com, each geographical area has local voluntary leaders who facilitate the monthly gatherings. These meetings centre around a series of slide-show presentations, called ‚Äúshow-and-tells,‚Äù which are usually filmed and later uploaded to internet blogs and websites (Christensen 2013). Anthropologist Adam Butterfield conducted his master‚Äôs thesis specifically on Quantified Self community meet-up groups and succinctly defined their content as ‚Äúpersonal stories of self-tracking projects‚Äù (Butterfield 2012). While this is a simplified description of how the ideology gets communicated between its members and the general public, in a literal sense its is fairly accurate. The emphasis on storytelling using meaningful data is a key component of the Quantified Self movement. Understanding how and why these stories are told is central to understanding the Quantified Self movement and the cultural forces driving and shaping it. Throughout this thesis I will cite many tracking tales told through blog posts, personal websites, filmed presentations, and second-hand accounts in articles. At meet-up presenters are advised to base their talk around three prime questions; first, explain what you did; second, explain how you did it; and third, explain what you learnt (Wolf 2011). Some meet-up communities further structure the story-telling form by suggesting that speakers limit their talks to five minutes, encouraging simple and clear communication (Christensen 2013). The purpose of these presentations is to offer ideas that others might spark inspiration from: different tools and methods for self-tracking, different variables to track, inventive solutions to common problems like trouble sleeping or stress at work. The movement sees themselves as trying to cultivate a ‚Äúculture of sharing‚Äù (Christensen 2013). The ultimate value they share is seeking self-improvement, and through sharing stories, hope to collaboratively encourage and support one another in that goal. Conferences follow a similar structure but are much larger events, usually drawing members from all over a region (such as Europe or the Pacific Northwest) instead of a single city.\n      The glue holding this community together is undeniably the website Quantifiedself.com. Much like an ever-expanding family tree, it branches outwards connecting a seemingly infinite number of links to online data logging tools, company pages for commercially produced tracking devices and services, YouTube and Vimeo videos of presentations, reviews of smartphone tracking applications, notable personal blogs of self-trackers, and relevant journalistic and academic articles. It is the central hub of this internet-based society.\n      Quantifiedself.com features many aspects typical of websites that facilitate open and interactive online societies; social forums, active commenting on blog postings, occasional surveys, prompts for open discussions, frequent guest writers, and interviews with notable community members (Quantified Self 2013). This includes a number of recurring features such as: ‚ÄúWhat We‚Äôre Reading‚Äù ‚Äì a compiled list of the latest publications and articles related to the Quantified Self movement, ‚ÄúToolmaker Talks‚Äù ‚Äì question and answer posts with the developers of popular tracking devices and applications, and ‚ÄúNumbers from Around the Web‚Äù ‚Äì a showcase of especially interesting self-experiments and the resulting data from community members (Quantified Self 2013). This small slice of what type of content is posted should make apparent this website is by no means written or controlled by a single or small handful of individuals.\n      While Kevin Kelly, Gary Wolf, and Alexandria Carmichael are the official moderators, the \n      majority of the material is generated from a large and diverse number of contributors. 2\n      2 Alexandria Carmichael is also the director of Quantified Self Labs, and co-founded the health tracking website CureTogether; a health care company ‚Äúthat brings patients with hundreds of conditions together in overlapping data communities‚Äù (CureTogether 2013).\n      Being an online social group, the nature of the Quantified Self community is fairly fluid with members interacting over ‚Äúmultisited situations with complex, spatially diverse‚Äù geographies (Wilson and Peterson 2002:455). In their review of the Anthropology of Online Communities, Wilson and Peterson point out that they are likely to be bound by ‚Äúasymmetrical, indirect connections,‚Äù as people are able to identify with the idea of being part of the community without necessarily making direct personal connections with others (Wilson and Peterson 2002:455). They may simply feel engagement and membership by reading the thoughts and ideas of other members on websites and blogs. The practices of connection can sometimes be socially passive. This quality makes the Quantified Self community an imagined community, a concept developed by political scientist Benedict Anderson to describe a socially-constructed unit where its members understand themselves to be part of a bound whole even in the absence of face-to- face interactions or social events. Becoming part of a community simply requires they imagine themselves to be so, much like being a member of a nation (Anderson 1991). However, in the case of the Quantified Self community, there are also many socially active and physically interactive ways members are bound together. Though geographically spread out over nations and internet cables, there is still a face-to-face aspect of the Quantified Self community in their regularly organised physical meet-ups and conferences. Quantified Self has been described as ‚Äúa grass-roots movement brought together by the internet‚Äù (Harrell 2011), emphasising its nature as democratic and community-driven. This strengthens their resemblance to traditional, localised communities where members are more likely to make direct and personal connections with one another.\n      \n      Leadership, Power Structures & Cohesion\n      Although Kevin Kelly and Gary Wolf are often referred to as the ‚Äúleaders‚Äù of the movement, the community tries to cultivate an open and democratic power structure where no single person or set of people speak for everyone. There are, however, many members who are more outspoken and active in publishing ideological writings on the Quantified Self, sometimes referred to as ‚Äúthought leaders‚Äù (Erwin 2012). These are individuals who usually run high-traffic blogs about their Quantified Self lifestyles, regularly publishing advice, reflections, and generally contributing content to the online community and the discussions happening within it. Quantified Selfers may not exactly align their tracking beliefs and habits with members who might be considered ‚Äúpopular‚Äù (who themselves hold a diverse range of beliefs around self- tracking), yet these individuals may have greater power and sway within the community thanks to their ability to influence the opinions of their readers. These informal leaders are frequently featured in interviews, articles, and publications about the movement. They appear to be prominent and well-respected figures within the community, with smaller self-tracking blogs frequently referring to and citing them in posts. However, they should not themselves be taken as absolute representations of the movement, nor should they be assumed to speak on behalf of the entire community (Erwin 2012). In his ethnographic work, Butterfield found it is certainly ‚Äúnot a monolithic community where everyone involved shares the same ideas about, and interests in, self-tracking‚Äù (Butterfield 212:49). Though Kelly and Wolf may have run the first Quantified Self meet-up, both believe the movement has ‚Äútaken on a life of its own, and in some ways, taken on a different meaning‚Äù (Butterfield 2012:16). The Quantified Self ideology itself has evolved in its short six year history, with different philosophies, values, and areas of focus rising and falling in popularity ‚Äì none consistent throughout or representative of the whole community, but fluctuating and developing through community discussions and dialogues. Above all other qualities of the movement, this lack of deterministic authority and communal openness to change maturation, and development of what it means to be a ‚ÄúQuantified Selfer‚Äù might be of the most seminal importance to understanding it authentically.\n      \n      On Ethnographic Sources\n      The vast majority of my ethnographic material is drawn from blog postings, essays, interviews in journalistic publications and newspapers, and filmed presentations created by people who make up the dedicated core of the movement. They are the leaders and avid participants, the organisers and enthusiasts, the writers and researchers. You will notice a repetition of names throughout my work: individuals like Kevin Kelly, Gary Wolf, Ernesto Ramirez, Konstantin Augemberg, Larry Smarr, gwern branwen [sic], and Buster Benson, among others, are all continuously cited across its chapters. The dominance of their voices is due to the dominance of their influence across the Quantified Self community, and the extensive efforts they put into writing and publishing about it. I recognise that this leaves my analysis vulnerable as an inaccurate representation of the more common or ‚Äútypical‚Äù Quantified Selfer who may not widely promote their beliefs and philosophies about self-tracking in publicly accessible places. However, there is no ‚Äúnormal‚Äù when it comes to the Quantified Self movement ‚Äì its membership is characterised by a wide diversity of opinions, habits, and levels of involvement. I have done my best to cast my net wide in selecting blogs, recorded talks, and stories to quote from and analyse ‚Äì presenting accounts ranging the ‚Äúthought leaders‚Äù who upload every detail of their day to public websites, to those who have only dabbled in a single experiment of self-quantification. Yet I concede my sources are limited to those who have chosen to freely share their experiences over the internet, a potentially self-selecting group. I have also likely left out the voices of many slightly less prominent ‚Äúthought leaders,‚Äù simply by limitation of the sheer number of them heading up different factions of the community, and that their opinions overlapped with those already represented. I have to some degree relied on the insights of anthropologists who are able to be physically present at Quantified Self meet-ups and conferences, primarily the work of Dawn Nafus and Jamie Sherman, and Adam Butterfield. Their expressed insights about the community, after engaging with people face-to-face and conducting many interviews, I believe grants them considerable legitimacy as second-hand ethnographic sources. */\n    }\n    {\n      /* \n      The Self-Tracker Identity\n      Identifying as a ‚ÄúQuantified Selfer‚Äù (the predominant self-referentially used term) requires two things; first, a lifestyle based around tracking data about oneself, and second, a conscious willingness to identity as such 3 \n      3  Throughout this thesis I will use the terms ‚ÄúQuantified Selfer,‚Äù ‚ÄúSelf Quantifier,‚Äù ‚Äúquantifier,‚Äù ‚Äúself- tracker,‚Äù and ‚Äútracker‚Äù interchangeably. This is based on the way I found those five terms to be used within the ethnographic material of the Quantified Self community. For the purposes of this paper you should assume they all refer to the same social identity being discussed here.\n      Being an identified Quantified Selfer is voluntary and self-assigned. An ownership of their tracking activity as a significant aspect of who they believe themselves to be. It is a public expression of a set of values and ideals that privately can hold a wide variety of meanings. Beyond the core belief in seeking self-improvement through collecting data, the rest is left up to the individual: track what you want, how you want, and do what you like with the data (Wolf 2010a). This open-ended invitation to have total agency of your own self-tracking lifestyle makes involvement and membership in the movement exceedingly undefined. What exactly it means to be a Quantified Selfer falls on a wide spectrum, and there are degrees to which a person can identify with and be involved in the community. Those who present at conferences and actively organise meet-ups likely take the identity more seriously than those who simply wear a popular commercial tracking device and occasionally read the Quantifiedself.com blog posts. Essentially, the level of involvement is flexible and the line between being a Quantified Selfer or not is fuzzy at best. This grey-area around what counts as being a ‚Äúmember‚Äù of the tracking movement requires some clarification as to who exactly I am discussing in this research. Therefore, I wish to clarify that am considering the baseline of membership to be an explicit, public and purposeful ownership of being a Quantified Selfer\n      Despite the wide variety of forms being a Quantified Selfer can take, and the insistence by community members that there is no such thing as an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù self-tracker, they certainly perceive a certain type of person to be drawn to the movement (Augemberg 2013a). They describe people who join as ‚Äúcurious‚Äù and ‚Äúgoal-oriented or problem-solving\n      oriented‚Äù (Christensen 2013). Many come from a science-minded perspective and are interested in ‚Äúpoking, prodding, and measuring as a way to go about the world‚Äù (Cornell 2010). Though inspired by scientific curiosity, they also revel in questioning existing mainstream social institutions like biomedicine and technoscience, believing their practices go against the grain of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù society. They repeatedly speak about themselves in narratives and terms that imply independence, difference, rebelliousness, radical thinking, and being defiant of the status quo, such as being self-proclaimed ‚Äúpioneers‚Äù (Kelly 2011; Wolf 2010a). Joining the movement seems to be more likely if you possess these certain character traits, but community members also suggest being part of the movement strengthens these qualities and subsequently changes the kind of lives people lead. Augemberg argues that the practice of self-tracking, Quantified Selfers become ‚Äúdifferent from other people with regard to mentality, psychological traits, lifestyle, and behaviours‚Äù (Augemberg 2013a). There is no doubt the movement understands itself as a social collective of like-minded individuals sharing an established set of values, qualifying them as a community.\n      \n      Shifting Norms\n      Back in 2010 ‚Äì the relative ‚Äúearly years‚Äù of the movement ‚Äì Wolf wrote of extreme quantifiers considering their behaviour to be ‚Äúabnormal,‚Äù and calling themselves ‚Äúoutliers‚Äù (Wolf 2010a). While the community still associates with leading lifestyles that deviate from the norm, many are experiencing a shift in the previously bizarre becoming more acceptable. Compulsive recordings of bodily numbers are no longer necessarily characterised as some form of anxiety disorder or signal of a lack of mental stability (Wolf 2010a). Still, in his ethnography Butterfield found self-trackers reported reluctance to divulge the full extent their tracking habits to those outside the movement, fearing they may be stigmatised and labeled ‚Äúobsessive compulsive, self- absorbed, or a hypochondriac‚Äù (Butterfield 2012: 60). They report others in their lives label them ‚Äúweird,‚Äù and yet simultaneously are assured that ‚Äúsoon everybody is going to be doing this, and you won‚Äôt even notice‚Äù (Wolf 2010a). The movement‚Äôs expansion seemingly instills confience that greater social acceptance is on the way. It therefore greatly serves the interests of those within the movement to promote the self-tracking lifestyle as increasingly normal and ordinary.\n      Many of the outspoken leaders of the movement are, naturally, quite optimistic about its potential rising popularity. Kelly sees the next century as leading us into an age of quantification; he believes industry will spur a new side to science and a new kind of lifestyle. He sees ‚Äúnew money, new tools, and a new philosophy stemming from measuring your whole life... It will be the new normal‚Äù (Kelly 2011). As this shift continues, it creates an interesting interplay with the dominant narratives that Quantified Selfers tell themselves about being ‚Äúpioneering self- trackers‚Äù (Kelly 2011). How they will maintain this core aspect of their collective identity if indeed their prediction of going mainstream is fulfilled remains to be seen.\n      \n      Self-Producing Pioneers\n      Fittingly, one intriguing quality of Quantified Selfers is the high number who are also the creators, inventors, and developers of self-tracking tools. In line with their philosophy of self- customisation and personalisation in the practice of self-tracking, it makes sense that many feel it is worth developing their own tools to serve their own specific interests and needs. Described as ‚Äútechnophiles, founders, and early adopters,‚Äù they engage in both the production and the use of their technological tools ‚Äì a continuous, circular feedback system (Dembosky 2011; Maqubela 2012). As most work in the industry of producing technological goods, they already have the skills and knowledge to do so. The New York meet-up survey cited earlier found that 30% of their members either work for a self-tracking related company or have created a self- quantification tool (Paulus 2013). Being both the creators and consumers of cutting edge tools and technological advancements legitimises their ‚Äúpioneer‚Äù self-image to an extent. They closely follow not only the new commodified gadgets and software applications that emerge on the market, but also the advances in computational power systems one step removed from the public eye ‚Äì inventions that could lead to possible new ways of integrating technologies into the self. They are inventing entirely new devices to integrate into their bodies, leading the frontier of technological development in an effort to be even more enmeshed in the digital age of enhancement. In this role they are shaping the forms and purposes of the technology that ‚Äútrickles down‚Äù to the rest of us in the mainstream hordes of technological consumerism. We should especially care about what they find significant, important, and meaningful - because to an extent they hold the power to determine what kind of technology we will use, and what we will use it for. There are concerns that should be raised around this form of power, especially considering the limited demographic of WEIRD individuals that currently make up the majority of the community. The political and social repercussions in areas such as healthcare and access across socioeconomic lines will be expanded upon later on.\n      \n      */\n    }\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
